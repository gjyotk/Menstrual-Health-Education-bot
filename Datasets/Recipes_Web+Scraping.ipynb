            "<p>Hormone fluctuations can lead to a decrease in blood sugar, creating an urge to eat sugary or carb-rich foods. This is because carbs are necessary for the production of serotonin, a chemical in the brain that promotes a feeling of well-being and happiness. <strong>Low serotonin levels may contribute to symptoms of PMS</strong>, such as premenstrual depression, fatigue, food cravings, and difficulty sleeping.</p>\n",
            "<p>It’s no wonder we crave these types of comfort foods around our period: They help distract us from painful menstrual cramps, fatigue, and the <a href=\"https://blog.flexfits.com/how-stress-affects-your-period/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">stress</a> that tends to ramp up right before period day one. Unfortunately, what we crave might not be what’s best for our bodies. Succumbing to that late-night Chick-Fil-A craving, red meat burgers, processed foods, and even spicy foods might actually leave you feeling worse.  </p>\n",
            "<p>On the flip side, <strong>many nutrient-rich foods help with </strong><a href=\"https://blog.flexfits.com/weird-ways-to-deal-with-pms-symptoms/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>cramps and Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS)</strong></a><strong>, by reducing their intensity or even making them disappear entirely.</strong> We’re not talking obscure, expensive herbs or potions – just the “boring” fruits and veggies you see lining the produce aisle of your average grocery store. Turns out, leafy greens and sweet potatoes have some pretty magical powers when it comes to reducing cramping and menstrual pain.  </p>\n",
            "<p>If you’re worried that getting the right nutrients during your period means sacrificing flavor, think again. We compiled a few Chrissy Teigen-worthy recipes of the best period comfort food that your body <em>and</em> your tastebuds will genuinely enjoy. Plus, they’re quick, easy to prepare, and can be done with limited kitchen equipment (read: even in your college dorm kitchen).  </p>\n",

            "<p>Dark chocolate is rich in magnesium: It contains 50 mg in every 1-oz serving.

            "<p>While you can certainly get extra magnesium in supplement form, the best way for your body to absorb it is by consuming foods that are naturally magnesium-rich. So, consider dark chocolate your new PMS BFF – and for even more magnesium, add tofu, pumpkin seeds, avocados, and almonds to your diet during your period.((Magnesium-Rich Food Information.

            "<p>If your usual habit is ordering takeout during your period from the local Chinese or Thai hole in the wall, you may be surprised by how easily you can recreate your favorite meals at home – but way healthier and, TBH, better tasting. This simple recipe is ready in under 30 minutes and is almost impossible to mess up.  </p>\n",
            "<p>How will it help your period, though? Well, for starters, the plentiful <strong>fresh ginger may significantly reduce period pain</strong>, a.k.a. dysmenorrhea: One 2012 study found that ginger “may be an effective and safe therapy for relieving pain in women with primary dysmenorrhea if administered at the onset or during the 3 days prior to menstruation.”((Rahnama, P., Montazeri, A., Huseini, H. F., Kianbakht, S., &amp; Naseri, M. (2012).

            "<p>Then you have baby bok choy, which contains loads of PMS-busting calcium (see above for the benefits of calcium for period pain) and is a great source of vitamin A, vitamin C, and potassium.((14 Non-Dairy Foods That Are High in Calcium.

            "<p>The avocado is pretty much the queen of health foods – it adds an amazing dimension of flavor and texture to just about any savory meal, whether breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and even tastes great on its own with a simple slice of bread. We can do better than bland ‘cado toast, though: This recipe makes a meal out of what might otherwise be considered a snack, and it has the perfect balance of salt, spice, crunch, and lemony pizzazz.  </p>\n",
            "<p>Why is it good for your period? Well, <strong>avocados have tons of magnesium, plus iron and potassium</strong>. The magnesium (as mentioned in the Overnight Oats recipe) can help with mood swings, stress, and the emotional burnout we often feel during our period.((Quaranta, S., Buscaglia, M.A., Meroni, M.G. et al.

            "<p>The iron is great if you experience especially heavy periods: The more blood you shed, the more prone you are to anemia (or an iron deficiency).((Peuranpää, P., Heliövaara‐Peippo, S., Fraser, I., Paavonen, J., &amp; Hurskainen, R.

Effects of anemia and iron deficiency on quality of life in women with heavy menstrual bleeding. <em>Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand</em>, 93, 654-660. https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.12394)) The pumpkin seeds have TONS of iron, too, so you’re pretty much fully covered in that department.  </p>\n",
            "<p>For added protein, top your toast with a fried or poached egg: You’ll benefit from the Vitamin D, which helps your body absorb the much-needed, PMS-fighting calcium found in other foods. Bonus points for multigrain bread made with flax seeds, which contain omega-3 fatty acids.  </p>\n",

            "<p>When you think about PMS or period food cravings, the first thing that comes to mind is usually cravings for chocolate – followed by salty chips, ice cream, and maybe a burger and fries, or Flaming Hot Cheetos.  </p>\n",
            "<p>Hormone fluctuations can lead to a decrease in blood sugar, creating an urge to eat sugary or carb-rich foods. This is because carbs are necessary for the production of serotonin, a chemical in the brain that promotes a feeling of well-being and happiness. <strong>Low serotonin levels may contribute to symptoms of PMS</strong>, such as premenstrual depression, fatigue, food cravings, and difficulty sleeping.</p>\n",
            "<p>It’s no wonder we crave these types of comfort foods around our period: They help distract us from painful menstrual cramps, fatigue, and the <a href=\"https://blog.flexfits.com/how-stress-affects-your-period/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">stress</a> that tends to ramp up right before period day one. Unfortunately, what we crave might not be what’s best for our bodies. Succumbing to that late-night Chick-Fil-A craving, red meat burgers, processed foods, and even spicy foods might actually leave you feeling worse.  </p>\n",
            "<p>On the flip side, <strong>many nutrient-rich foods help with </strong><a href=\"https://blog.flexfits.com/weird-ways-to-deal-with-pms-symptoms/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>cramps and Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS)</strong></a><strong>, by reducing their intensity or even making them disappear entirely.</strong> We’re not talking obscure, expensive herbs or potions – just the “boring” fruits and veggies you see lining the produce aisle of your average grocery store. Turns out, leafy greens and sweet potatoes have some pretty magical powers when it comes to reducing cramping and menstrual pain.  </p>\n",
            "<p>If you’re worried that getting the right nutrients during your period means sacrificing flavor, think again. We compiled a few Chrissy Teigen-worthy recipes of the best period comfort food that your body <em>and</em> your tastebuds will genuinely enjoy. Plus, they’re quick, easy to prepare, and can be done with limited kitchen equipment (read: even in your college dorm kitchen).  </p>\n",

            "<p>Dark chocolate is rich in magnesium: It contains 50 mg in every 1-oz serving.

            "<p>While you can certainly get extra magnesium in supplement form, the best way for your body to absorb it is by consuming foods that are naturally magnesium-rich. So, consider dark chocolate your new PMS BFF – and for even more magnesium, add tofu, pumpkin seeds, avocados, and almonds to your diet during your period.((Magnesium-Rich Food Information.

Well, for starters, the plentiful <strong>fresh ginger may significantly reduce period pain</strong>, a.k.a. dysmenorrhea: One 2012 study found that ginger “may be an effective and safe therapy for relieving pain in women with primary dysmenorrhea if administered at the onset or during the 3 days prior to menstruation.”((Rahnama, P., Montazeri, A., Huseini, H.

            "<p>The avocado is pretty much the queen of health foods – it adds an amazing dimension of flavor and texture to just about any savory meal, whether breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and even tastes great on its own with a simple slice of bread.

            "<p>Why is it good for your period? Well, <strong>avocados have tons of magnesium, plus iron and potassium</strong>.

            "<p>The iron is great if you experience especially heavy periods: The more blood you shed, the more prone you are to anemia (or an iron deficiency).((Peuranpää, P., Heliövaara‐Peippo, S., Fraser, I., Paavonen, J., &amp; Hurskainen, R.

            "<p>For added protein, top your toast with a fried or poached egg: You’ll benefit from the Vitamin D, which helps your body absorb the much-needed, PMS-fighting calcium found in other foods.

            "<p>The avocado is pretty much the queen of health foods – it adds an amazing dimension of flavor and texture to just about any savory meal, whether breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and even tastes great on its own with a simple slice of bread. We can do better than bland ‘cado toast, though: This recipe makes a meal out of what might otherwise be considered a snack, and it has the perfect balance of salt, spice, crunch, and lemony pizzazz.  </p>\n",
            "<p>Why is it good for your period? Well, <strong>avocados have tons of magnesium, plus iron and potassium</strong>. The magnesium (as mentioned in the Overnight Oats recipe) can help with mood swings, stress, and the emotional burnout we often feel during our period.((Quaranta, S., Buscaglia, M.A., Meroni, M.G. et al. Pilot Study of the Efficacy and Safety of a Modified-Release Magnesium 250mg Tablet for the Treatment of Premenstrual Syndrome. <em>Clin. Drug Investig</em>. 27, 51–58 (2007). https://doi.org/10.2165/00044011-200727010-00004)) </p>\n",
            "<p>The iron is great if you experience especially heavy periods: The more blood you shed, the more prone you are to anemia (or an iron deficiency).((Peuranpää, P., Heliövaara‐Peippo, S., Fraser, I., Paavonen, J., &amp; Hurskainen, R.

Effects of anemia and iron deficiency on quality of life in women with heavy menstrual bleeding. <em>Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand</em>, 93, 654-660. https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.12394)) The pumpkin seeds have TONS of iron, too, so you’re pretty much fully covered in that department.  </p>\n",
            "<p>For added protein, top your toast with a fried or poached egg: You’ll benefit from the Vitamin D, which helps your body absorb the much-needed, PMS-fighting calcium found in other foods. Bonus points for multigrain bread made with flax seeds, which contain omega-3 fatty acids.  </p>\n",

            "[<p>When you think about PMS or period food cravings, the first thing that comes to mind is usually cravings for chocolate – followed by salty chips, ice cream, and maybe a burger and fries, or Flaming Hot Cheetos.  </p>, <p>Hormone fluctuations can lead to a decrease in blood sugar, creating an urge to eat sugary or carb-rich foods. This is because carbs are necessary for the production of serotonin, a chemical in the brain that promotes a feeling of well-being and happiness. <strong>Low serotonin levels may contribute to symptoms of PMS</strong>, such as premenstrual depression, fatigue, food cravings, and difficulty sleeping.</p>, <p>It’s no wonder we crave these types of comfort foods around our period: They help distract us from painful menstrual cramps, fatigue, and the <a href=\"https://blog.flexfits.com/how-stress-affects-your-period/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">stress</a> that tends to ramp up right before period day one. Unfortunately, what we crave might not be what’s best for our bodies. Succumbing to that late-night Chick-Fil-A craving, red meat burgers, processed foods, and even spicy foods might actually leave you feeling worse.  </p>, <p>On the flip side, <strong>many nutrient-rich foods help with </strong><a href=\"https://blog.flexfits.com/weird-ways-to-deal-with-pms-symptoms/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>cramps and Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS)</strong></a><strong>, by reducing their intensity or even making them disappear entirely.</strong> We’re not talking obscure, expensive herbs or potions – just the “boring” fruits and veggies you see lining the produce aisle of your average grocery store. Turns out, leafy greens and sweet potatoes have some pretty magical powers when it comes to reducing cramping and menstrual pain.  </p>, <p>If you’re worried that getting the right nutrients during your period means sacrificing flavor, think again. We compiled a few Chrissy Teigen-worthy recipes of the best period comfort food that your body <em>and</em> your tastebuds will genuinely enjoy. Plus, they’re quick, easy to prepare, and can be done with limited kitchen equipment (read: even in your college dorm kitchen).  </p>, <p>Kiss cramps, bloating, fatigue, and breakouts goodbye with these five recipes for PMS or period pain.  </p>, <p>What, did you think we wouldn’t include chocolate in at least one of these recipes? Of course we did. Even better, you get to eat it for breakfast (and it’s actually good for you). </p>, <p>Dark chocolate is rich in magnesium: It contains 50 mg in every 1-oz serving. And studies have found that <strong>magnesium can be helpful in reducing PMS symptoms</strong>, especially mood swings and stress, which may be more common if you’re nutrient deficient.((Quaranta, S., Buscaglia, M.A., Meroni, M.G. et al.

Drug Investig</em>. 27, 51–58 (2007). https://doi.org/10.2165/00044011-200727010-00004)) Magnesium may also ease headaches and curb sugar cravings.((Mauskop, A., Altura, B. T., Cracco, R.

Intravenous magnesium sulfate rapidly alleviates headaches of various types. <em>Headache</em>, 36(3), 154–160. https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1526-4610.1996.3603154.x)) </p>, <p>While you can certainly get extra magnesium in supplement form, the best way for your body to absorb it is by consuming foods that are naturally magnesium-rich. So, consider dark chocolate your new PMS BFF – and for even more magnesium, add tofu, pumpkin seeds, avocados, and almonds to your diet during your period.((Magnesium-Rich Food Information. (2014, December 1). <em>Cleveland Clinic</em>. Retrieved from my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/15650-magnesium-rich-food)) </p>, <p>Other helpful ingredients in this overnight oats recipe include cinnamon, which has also been shown to improve pain, nausea, and vomiting associated with primary dysmenorrhea,<sup><a class=\"footnote-link footnote-identifier-link\" href=\"#footnote_0_5024\" id=\"identifier_0_5024\" title=\"Jaafarpour, M., Hatefi, M., Najafi, F., Khajavikhan, J., &amp; Khani, A.

Make it as easy as possible for yourself with this single-sheet pan dinner.</p>, <p>You’ll have plenty of leftover pesto, too, to use up later in the week for pasta or a salad. The powerhouse ingredients will make you feel amazing any day of the month, but they’re especially helpful when you’re on your period. Here’s why: </p>, <p>First, salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids,((Omega-3-rich foods: Good for your heart. (2013, November 1). <em>Harvard Health</em>. Retrieved from health.harvard.edu/heart-health/omega-3-rich-foods-good-for-your-heart)) which are beneficial for so many different aspects of your health. In terms of period pain, <strong>omega-3s have been shown to reduce both the mental symptoms of PMS (like depression, nervousness, anxiety, and lack of concentration) and the physical symptoms (like bloating, headache, and breast tenderness).</strong>((Sohrabi, N., Kashanian, M., Ghafoori, S. S., &amp; Malakouti, S. K. (2013). Evaluation of the effect of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome: “a pilot trial”. <em>Complementary therapies in medicine</em>, 21(3), 141–146. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctim.2012.12.008)) </p>, <p>Salmon has 1,900 mg of omega-3s per 3 oz serving – and the walnuts in the pesto pack a punch, too, with 2,570 mg per ounce.((Hjalmarsdottir, F. (2019, September 30). 12 Foods That Are Very High in Omega-3. <em>Healthline</em>. Retrieved from healthline.com/nutrition/12-omega-3-rich-foods)) The sweet potato offers complex carbohydrates (the good ones!) and lots of Vitamin B6, which has also been studied for its PMS-relieving effects,((Fathizadeh, N., Ebrahimi, E., Valiani, M., Tavakoli, N., &amp; Yar, M. H. (2010). Evaluating the effect of magnesium and magnesium plus vitamin B6 supplement on the severity of premenstrual syndrome. <em>Iranian journal of nursing and midwifery research</em>, 15(Suppl 1), 401–405.)) plus Vitamin C for an immune system boost. </p>, <p>Finally, the broccoli rabe contains 100 mg of calcium in a 2/3rds-cup serving.((14 Non-Dairy Foods That Are High in Calcium. (2014, September 7). <em>Time</em>. Retrieved from time.com/3265401/14-high-calcium-foods/)) Calcium has been fairly extensively studied in correlation with premenstrual symptoms, and there’s a strong indication that high calcium intake reduces the risk of PMS.((Bertone-Johnson, E. R., Hankinson, S. E., Bendich, A., Johnson, S. R., Willett, W. C., &amp; Manson, J. E. (2005). Calcium and vitamin D intake and risk of incident premenstrual syndrome. <em>Archives of internal medicine</em>, 165(11), 1246–1252. https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.165.11.1246))</p>, <p><em>For the pesto: </em></p>, <p>If your usual habit is ordering takeout during your period from the local Chinese or Thai hole in the wall, you may be surprised by how easily you can recreate your favorite meals at home – but way healthier and, TBH, better tasting. This simple recipe is ready in under 30 minutes and is almost impossible to mess up.  </p>, <p>How will it help your period, though? Well, for starters, the plentiful <strong>fresh ginger may significantly reduce period pain</strong>, a.k.a. dysmenorrhea: One 2012 study found that ginger “may be an effective and safe therapy for relieving pain in women with primary dysmenorrhea if administered at the onset or during the 3 days prior to menstruation.”((Rahnama, P., Montazeri, A., Huseini, H. F., Kianbakht, S., &amp; Naseri, M. (2012). Effect of Zingiber officinale R. rhizomes (ginger) on pain relief in primary dysmenorrhea: a placebo randomized trial. <em>BMC complementary and alternative medicine</em>, 12, 92. https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-12-92)) Plus, ginger has long been used to remedy an upset stomach – and it just tastes good, so don’t skimp!</p>, <p>Then you have baby bok choy, which contains loads of PMS-busting calcium (see above for the benefits of calcium for period pain) and is a great source of vitamin A, vitamin C, and potassium.((14 Non-Dairy Foods That Are High in Calcium. (2014, September 7). <em>Time</em>. Retrieved from time.com/3265401/14-high-calcium-foods/)) The shiitake mushrooms may have an anti-inflammatory effect, too.((Finimundy, T. C., Dillon, A. J., Henriques, J. A., &amp; Ely, M. R. (2014). A review on general nutritional compounds and pharmacological properties the Lentinula edodes Mushroom. <em>Food and Nutrition Sciences</em>, 05(12), 1095-1105. https://doi.org/10.4236/fns.2014.512119))</p>, <p>The avocado is pretty much the queen of health foods – it adds an amazing dimension of flavor and texture to just about any savory meal, whether breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and even tastes great on its own with a simple slice of bread. We can do better than bland ‘cado toast, though: This recipe makes a meal out of what might otherwise be considered a snack, and it has the perfect balance of salt, spice, crunch, and lemony pizzazz.  </p>, <p>Why is it good for your period? Well, <strong>avocados have tons of magnesium, plus iron and potassium</strong>. The magnesium (as mentioned in the Overnight Oats recipe) can help with mood swings, stress, and the emotional burnout we often feel during our period.((Quaranta, S., Buscaglia, M.A., Meroni, M.G. et al. Pilot Study of the Efficacy and Safety of a Modified-Release Magnesium 250mg Tablet for the Treatment of Premenstrual Syndrome. <em>Clin. Drug Investig</em>. 27, 51–58 (2007). https://doi.org/10.2165/00044011-200727010-00004)) </p>, <p>The iron is great if you experience especially heavy periods: The more blood you shed, the more prone you are to anemia (or an iron deficiency).((Peuranpää, P., Heliövaara‐Peippo, S., Fraser, I., Paavonen, J., &amp; Hurskainen, R. (2014). Effects of anemia and iron deficiency on quality of life in women with heavy menstrual bleeding. <em>Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand</em>, 93, 654-660. https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.12394)) The pumpkin seeds have TONS of iron, too, so you’re pretty much fully covered in that department.  </p>, <p>For added protein, top your toast with a fried or poached egg: You’ll benefit from the Vitamin D, which helps your body absorb the much-needed, PMS-fighting calcium found in other foods. Bonus points for multigrain bread made with flax seeds, which contain omega-3 fatty acids.  </p>, <p>This last recipe is another versatile, “in-between” type of meal: Have it for breakfast, as a post-workout pick-me-up, or even as a light lunch or dinner. You can add more protein powder or tofu if you want to make it heartier (or skip those ingredients if you don’t have ‘em on hand – no big deal). Keep frozen fruit in your freezer at all times for quick, simple smoothies on the go.  </p>, <p>Period-wise, just about every ingredient in this smoothie has something to offer. There’s the avocado which, as mentioned, <strong>gives you healthy fats, cramp-relieving magnesium, and iron.</strong>((Quaranta, S., Buscaglia, M.A., Meroni, M.G. et al. Pilot Study of the Efficacy and Safety of a Modified-Release Magnesium 250mg Tablet for the Treatment of Premenstrual Syndrome. <em>Clin. Drug Investig</em>. 27, 51–58 (2007). https://doi.org/10.2165/00044011-200727010-00004)) There’s the spinach, which has even MORE iron than the avocado and is an all-around PMS powerhouse food with tons of calcium.((Gunnars, K. (2019, May 14). Spinach 101: Nutrition Facts and Health Benefits. <em>Healthline</em>. Retrieved from healthline.com/nutrition/foods/spinach)) </p>, <p>The yogurt adds a probiotic boost. There’s the chia seeds and flax seeds with omega-3 fatty acids. And there’s enough berries and orange juice to hit more than 100% of your daily value of Vitamin C.((Robertson, R. (2020, August 19).

BMC complementary and alternative medicine, 12, 92. https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-12-92)) Plus, ginger has long been used to remedy an upset stomach – and it just tastes good, so don’t skimp!\n",
            " \n",
            "para: Then you have baby bok choy, which contains loads of PMS-busting calcium (see above for the benefits of calcium for period pain) and is a great source of vitamin A, vitamin C, and potassium.((14 Non-Dairy Foods That Are High in Calcium. (2014, September 7). Time. Retrieved from time.com/3265401/14-high-calcium-foods/)) The shiitake mushrooms may have an anti-inflammatory effect, too.((Finimundy, T. C., Dillon, A. J., Henriques, J. A., & Ely, M. R. (2014). A review on general nutritional compounds and pharmacological properties the Lentinula edodes Mushroom. Food and Nutrition Sciences, 05(12), 1095-1105. https://doi.org/10.4236/fns.2014.512119))\n",
            " \n",
            "para: The avocado is pretty much the queen of health foods – it adds an amazing dimension of flavor and texture to just about any savory meal, whether breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and even tastes great on its own with a simple slice of bread. We can do better than bland ‘cado toast, though: This recipe makes a meal out of what might otherwise be considered a snack, and it has the perfect balance of salt, spice, crunch, and lemony pizzazz.  \n",
            " \n",
            "para: Why is it good for your period? Well, avocados have tons of magnesium, plus iron and potassium. The magnesium (as mentioned in the Overnight Oats recipe) can help with mood swings, stress, and the emotional burnout we often feel during our period.((Quaranta, S., Buscaglia, M.A., Meroni, M.G. et al. Pilot Study of the Efficacy and Safety of a Modified-Release Magnesium 250mg Tablet for the Treatment of Premenstrual Syndrome. Clin. Drug Investig. 27, 51–58 (2007). https://doi.org/10.2165/00044011-200727010-00004)) \n",

            "para: The iron is great if you experience especially heavy periods: The more blood you shed, the more prone you are to anemia (or an iron deficiency).((Peuranpää, P., Heliövaara‐Peippo, S., Fraser, I., Paavonen, J., & Hurskainen, R. (2014). Effects of anemia and iron deficiency on quality of life in women with heavy menstrual bleeding. Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand, 93, 654-660. https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.12394)) The pumpkin seeds have TONS of iron, too, so you’re pretty much fully covered in that department.  \n",
            " \n",
            "para: For added protein, top your toast with a fried or poached egg: You’ll benefit from the Vitamin D, which helps your body absorb the much-needed, PMS-fighting calcium found in other foods. Bonus points for multigrain bread made with flax seeds, which contain omega-3 fatty acids.  \n",
            " \n",
            "para: This last recipe is another versatile, “in-between” type of meal: Have it for breakfast, as a post-workout pick-me-up, or even as a light lunch or dinner. You can add more protein powder or tofu if you want to make it heartier (or skip those ingredients if you don’t have ‘em on hand – no big deal). Keep frozen fruit in your freezer at all times for quick, simple smoothies on the go.  \n",
            " \n",
            "para: Period-wise, just about every ingredient in this smoothie has something to offer. There’s the avocado which, as mentioned, gives you healthy fats, cramp-relieving magnesium, and iron.((Quaranta, S., Buscaglia, M.A., Meroni, M.G. et al. Pilot Study of the Efficacy and Safety of a Modified-Release Magnesium 250mg Tablet for the Treatment of Premenstrual Syndrome. Clin. Drug Investig. 27, 51–58 (2007). https://doi.org/10.2165/00044011-200727010-00004)) There’s the spinach, which has even MORE iron than the avocado and is an all-around PMS powerhouse food with tons of calcium.((Gunnars, K.
