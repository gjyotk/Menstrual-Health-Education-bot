1,2. Sheet pan pesto salmon with roasted sweet potato & broccoli rabe,"
2 (6oz.) salmon fillets (wild-caught is our favorite if you can find it)
1 cup broccoli rabe, trimmed with tough stems removed
1 ½ sweet potatoes, cubed
½ tsp smoked paprika
1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 lemon, sliced into wedges

1/3 cup walnuts
2 large garlic cloves, roughly chopped
2 cups gently packed *fresh* basil leaves
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
","
Preheat the oven to 400° F.
Spray a large sheet pan with non-stick spray or cover with parchment paper.
Make the pesto: Place the walnuts and garlic in a food processor and pulse until chopped. Add the basil, salt, and pepper, and pulse until the mixture looks like a thick paste. Then, with the food processor running, add your olive oil in a steady stream until fully incorporated. Add the parmesan and pulse 30 seconds more. Store in a mason jar for up to a week in the fridge. 
Toss cubed sweet potatoes in a bowl with ½ tablespoon of olive oil, salt, and smoked paprika. Spread on one side of the sheet pan in an even layer. 
Place sweet potatoes in the oven for 15 minutes until partially cooked. Remove the pan from the oven, flip the sweet potatoes. 
Toss broccoli rabe with the other ½ tablespoon of olive oil, salt and pepper and spread on the other side of the sheet pan, leaving enough room for your salmon fillets. 
Place salmon fillets in the middle of the sheet pan and top each with a heaping spoonful of your homemade pesto so it covers each fillet. Place 1 lemon wedge on each fillet. 
Place the sheet pan back in the oven and bake for 15 minutes (you may need to leave the salmon in a couple of minutes longer depending on thickness).
