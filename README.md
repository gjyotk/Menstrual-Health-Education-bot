# Menstral Health Education (MHE) Bots

## Overview

Millions of women around the world lack access to accurate and reliable information about menstrual health and hygiene. The stigma and taboos surrounding menstruation often lead to misinformation, with only 48% of adolescent girls in India aware of menstruation before their first period (Dasra, 2014). These gaps in knowledge thus result in poor menstrual hygiene, health complications, and reduced quality of life.

This chatbot is a small step towards creating awareness and addressing these issues by creating chatbots to educate women and young girls about menstrual health. The chatbots leverage fine-tuned Gemini 1.5 Flash and fine-tuned Flan T5-Base models to provide accurate, empathetic, and personalized responses. By delivering accessible and reliable information, the chatbots aim to empower women to make informed decisions about their health.
