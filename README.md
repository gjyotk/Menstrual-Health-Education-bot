## About

Womenâ€™s Health Recommendation System aims to address major gaps in the existing menstrual tracking apps by leveraging the power of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** in creating personalized health recommendations. It uses crowdsourced data and an informed health management system to create a positive menstrual narrative among users. 



## Our Solution
A Large Language Model based recommendation system that:

- Uses advanced algorithms to accurately predict the phases of the menstrual cycle (e.g., menstrual phase, follicular phase, ovulatory phase, luteal phase) by the use of variations in heart rate, QTc, and QT intervals in ECG readings.
- Use of crowdsourced data to enhance and optimize recommendation algorithms based on shared knowledge and experiences.
- Dismantling stigma and fostering a culture of informed menstrual health management through educational resources, supportive content, and community engagement features.



## Drawbacks of Current Menstrual Tracking Applications

The existing women's health tracking apps primarily focus on symptom tracking and menstrual date prediction. They completely overlook the possibility of any enhancement in women's physical health and immunity. Major drawbacks in existing systems:
 
- Current apps overlook complex hormonal variations during menopause, menarche, and hormonal diseases, leading to inaccurate date predictions. 
- Menstrual tracking apps lack proactive health recommendations, hindering healthy habits tailored to cycles. 
- Many apps perpetuate stigma around menstruation, neglecting to promote positive menstrual health knowledge and excluding gender and sexual minorities.
